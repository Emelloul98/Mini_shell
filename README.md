# Custom Shell Program in C

This repository contains a custom shell program implemented in C. The shell provides functionalities similar to common Unix-like shell environments, including command execution, variable substitution, background processes, pipes, signal handling, and input/output redirection.

## Features

1. **Command execution:** Execute user-entered commands with support for arguments.
2. **Variable substitution:** Define and use variables, replacing `$var` with their meanings.
3. **Background processes:** Run processes in the background using the `&` symbol.
4. **Pipes:** Chain commands together using pipes for input and output redirection.
5. **Signal handling:** Handle signals such as SIGCHLD for child process termination and SIGTSTP for suspending processes.
6. **Input/output redirection:** Redirect input and output to/from files using `>`.

## Usage

1. **Compile:** Compile the source code using your preferred C compiler (e.g., gcc).
   ```bash
   gcc -o custom_shell custom_shell.c
   ```
2. **Run:** Run the compiled executable.
   ```bash
   ./custom_shell
   ```
3. **Enter Commands:** Enter commands and interact with the custom shell.

### Examples

- Execute a command:
  ```bash
  $ ls -l
  ```

- Variable substitution:
  ```bash
  $ VAR_NAME=value
  $ echo $VAR_NAME
  ```

- Background process:
  ```bash
  $ sleep 10 &
  ```

- Pipe commands:
  ```bash
  $ ls -l | grep ".txt"
  ```

- Input/output redirection:
  ```bash
  $ ls -l > output.txt
  ```
